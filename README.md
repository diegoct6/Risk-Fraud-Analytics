# Risk & Fraud Analytics

Predictive modeling projects developed during the Risk & Fraud Analytics course (Master in Business Analytics & Big Data) at IE HST.

Akwnoledgements: I here make a great use of the starter code as well as other codes provided by Professor Manoel Gadi.

1. Competition for Online Fraud Dectection Model
This is the code that achived a maximum grade for the Kaggle style competition in which we had to develop a model to detect fraud for a startup. This startup operates in Peru with inititally 800 customers that later grew.

The approach I follow in my discovery for the best predictive model are roughly organized around the following steps:

- Sampling and Performance Definition
- Model Evaluation: KS and Gini
- Models Trials: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, KNN, SVM, Random Forrest, XGBClassifier, LGBMClassifier, Neural Network, and CatBoostClassifier
- Hyperparameter tunning
- Feature Selection
- Preprocessing the variables

I provide the code I used as well as a detailed logbook.
